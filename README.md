# Grocerry-Store-System
This is a cachier system for supermarket done using some algorithms and data structures in C++ programming language.
this project have several functions which handle all the requests of the worker and make it very eassy for him/her in the work

#the use algorithms:
-Greedy Algorithm.
-merge sort Algorithm
-Brute-force Algorithm
-Divide and conquer
-Transfer and conquer Algorithm
-Binary searchAlgorithm
